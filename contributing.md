## Adding a Wallpaper

### Wallpaper requirements

Requirements for wallpaper repositories added to this list:
- The '.heic' file should be easily downloadable.
- The image size of the wallpaper should be clearly presented (preferably in the readme).
- The wallpaper repo should link back to <https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic> (so that if someone independently finds the wallpaper, they can easily get the software required).
- The original designer (if not the same as the repo maintainer) should be credited (given there is no way of enforcing this except for trust).
- See [this repo](https://github.com/aerfanr/fedora-33-kde-dynamic-wallpaper/tree/12fe837e0df4e352a19949b21fd922a087b0bb3c) for a good example of a repository following the guidelines.

Most of the above are obvious but I wanted to write them down to have a baseline for any wallpapers in this 'awesome' wallpapers repo  

### With a pull request

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Name the PR "Add Wallpaper: --name of wallpaper--"
- Make sure to include the repository maintainer and artist
- Images in the README.md should be in this format \<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmanyaahm/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic-spaceship-you-creative/master/contents/images/preview.jpg" width="600"\> with width 600 being the most important part.

### By opening an issue

Ensure your issue adheres to the following guidelines:

- Name the issue "Add Wallpaper: --name of wallpaper--"
- Provide a link to the wallpaper repository (obviously).
- Make sure the image repository adheres to the guidelines [above](#wallpaper-requirements)

  
  
Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
