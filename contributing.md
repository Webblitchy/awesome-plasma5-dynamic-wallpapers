## Adding a Wallpaper

### Wallpaper requirements

Requirements for wallpaper repositories added to this list:
- The '.heic' (version 3) or '.avif' (version 4) file should be easily downloadable.
- The image size of the wallpaper should be clearly presented (preferably in the readme).
- The wallpaper repo should link back to <https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic> (so that if someone independently finds the wallpaper, they can easily get the software required).
- The original designer (if not the same as the repo maintainer) should be credited (given there is no way of enforcing this except for trust).
- See [this repo](https://github.com/aerfanr/fedora-33-kde-dynamic-wallpaper/tree/12fe837e0df4e352a19949b21fd922a087b0bb3c) for a good example of a repository following the guidelines.

Most of the above are obvious but I wanted to write them down to have a baseline for any wallpapers in this 'awesome' wallpapers repo  

### With a pull request

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Name the PR "Add Wallpaper: --name of wallpaper--"
- Make sure to include the repository maintainer and artist
- Images in the README.md should be in this format \<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmanyaahm/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic-spaceship-you-creative/master/contents/images/preview.jpg" width="600"\> with width 600 being the most important part.

### By opening an issue

Ensure your issue adheres to the following guidelines:

- Name the issue "Add Wallpaper: --name of wallpaper--"
- Provide a link to the wallpaper repository (obviously).
- Make sure the image repository adheres to the guidelines [above](#wallpaper-requirements)
