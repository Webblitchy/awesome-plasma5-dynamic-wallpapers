# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Requirements for repositories added to this list:
- The '.heic' file should be easily downloadable
- The image size of the wallpaper should be clearly presented (preferably in the readme)
- The wallpaper repo should link back to <https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic>
- The original designer (if not the same as the repo maintainer) should be credited (given there is no way of enforcing this except for trust)

Most of the above are obvious but I wanted to write them down to have a baseline for any wallpapers in this 'awesome' wallpapers repo  



Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Name the PR "Add Wallpaper: --name of wallpaper--"
- Make sure to include the repository maintainer and artist
- The image linked should be "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\<username>/\<repo name>/\<file path>" due to image formatting issues that I don't understand.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
